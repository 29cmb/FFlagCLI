# FFlag Command Line Utility ðŸš©
You thought a discord bot and roblox module was enough? Think again. This is the third and final frontend for my FFlag System. Connects with my [backend source code](https://github.com/29cmb/FFlagAPI) for FastFlags

## What is a Fast Flag?
A fast flag is a key value pair which is used to asynchronously toggle features on multiple different instances without having to manually update every single one, very useful for games and high-traffic services which can't have long down-time/outages.
